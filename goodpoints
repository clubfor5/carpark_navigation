1.Different with particle filter constrain:
  1) Dicretize the orientation, states and transition of states so reduce the computation power. 

2.Modeling: Huber loss for outlier (Multi gaussian?)

3.Turn detection(Complementary of orientation constrain)

4.Particle filter: 钻牛角尖, need much more particles to get the distribution
